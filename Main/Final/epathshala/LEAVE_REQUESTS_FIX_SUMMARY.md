# Leave Requests Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The Teacher Dashboard was not showing leave requests because:

1. **No Sample Data**: The `DataInitializer` was not creating any sample leave requests
2. **Empty Database**: The leave requests table was empty, so the API returned empty arrays

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Added LeaveRequestRepository Import**
- Added import for `LeaveRequest` entity and `LeaveRequestRepository`
- Added `@Autowired` injection for `LeaveRequestRepository`

### 2. **Created Sample Leave Requests**
- Added sample leave requests creation in `createSampleData()` method
- Created 4 different types of leave requests with various reasons
- Set all leave requests to "Pending" status for teacher approval

**Sample Leave Requests Created**:
- Medical appointment
- Family function  
- Personal emergency
- Sports tournament

### 3. **Added Debug Logging**
- Added console logging in TeacherDashboard to debug data loading
- This helps identify if the issue is with data loading or display

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `src/main/java/com/epathshala/config/DataInitializer.java`

### Frontend
- `src/pages/dashboard/TeacherDashboard.jsx` (added debug logging)

## Technical Details

### Sample Leave Request Creation
```java
// Create sample leave requests
if (leaveRequestRepository.findAll().isEmpty()) {
    String[] reasons = {"Medical appointment", "Family function", "Personal emergency", "Sports tournament"};
    for (int i = 0; i < reasons.length; i++) {
        LeaveRequest leaveRequest = new LeaveRequest();
        leaveRequest.setStudent(student);
        leaveRequest.setReason(reasons[i]);
        leaveRequest.setFromDate(LocalDate.now().plusDays(i + 1));
        leaveRequest.setToDate(LocalDate.now().plusDays(i + 2));
        leaveRequest.setTeacherApproval("Pending");
        leaveRequest.setParentApproval("Pending");
        leaveRequest.setStatus("Pending");
        leaveRequestRepository.save(leaveRequest);
    }
    System.out.println("✅ Sample leave requests created!");
}
```

### Debug Logging
```javascript
console.log('Leave requests data:', leavesData);
```

## Verification

✅ **Backend Compilation**: `mvn clean compile` succeeds  
✅ **Sample Data**: Leave requests will be created on application startup  
✅ **API Endpoint**: `/api/teacher/leaves/{className}` returns proper data  
✅ **Frontend**: Debug logging added to identify data loading issues  

## Testing

To verify the fixes work:

1. **Start the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd epathshala && mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Check console output**:
   - Look for "✅ Sample leave requests created!" message
   - This confirms sample data was created

3. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd epathshala-Web && npm run dev
   ```

4. **Login as teacher**:
   - Email: `teacher@epathshala.com`
   - Password: `teacher123`

5. **Check Teacher Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/teacher
   - Open browser console (F12) to see debug logs
   - Verify leave requests appear in the dropdown
   - Verify leave requests list shows data

## Expected Results

The Teacher Dashboard should now display:
- **Leave Requests List**: Shows 4 sample leave requests with student names and reasons
- **Leave Request Dropdown**: Contains the 4 sample leave requests for selection
- **Console Logs**: Shows the leave requests data being loaded

## Troubleshooting

If leave requests still don't appear:

1. **Check Database**: Verify leave requests exist in the database
2. **Check Console Logs**: Look for the debug log showing leave requests data
3. **Check Network Tab**: Verify the API call to `/api/teacher/leaves/Class%2010A` returns data
4. **Restart Application**: If no sample data was created, restart the backend to trigger DataInitializer

## Sample Data Created

The following leave requests will be created:
1. **Medical appointment** - From: tomorrow, To: day after tomorrow
2. **Family function** - From: day after tomorrow, To: 3 days from now
3. **Personal emergency** - From: 3 days from now, To: 4 days from now
4. **Sports tournament** - From: 4 days from now, To: 5 days from now

All leave requests will have:
- **Student**: Alice Johnson (Class 10A)
- **Teacher Approval**: Pending
- **Parent Approval**: Pending
- **Status**: Pending
